## Streaming

I have been experimenting with VTube streaming. I am still new to streaming so I am learning as I go. I sream a few games and development on my TTS software [VTuberVoice](https://github.com/VioletBitKitten/VTuberVoice).

## VtuberVoice

I do not like to talk so I am developing [TTS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_synthesis) (Text to Speech) software for VTubers called [VTuberVoice](https://github.com/VioletBitKitten/VTuberVoice).
[VTuberVoice](https://github.com/VioletBitKitten/VTuberVoice) is TTS software for vtubers that don't or can't speak.
VTuberVoice is written in FreePascal using the [Microsoft Windows SAPI library for FreePascal](https://github.com/VioletBitKitten/SAPI) I also created.
I created this software because I do not like to talk and there are few solutions for VTubers that don't speak.

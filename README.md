## Streaming

I have been experimenting with VTube streaming. I do not like to talk so I am developing TTS software for VTubers called [VTuberVoice](https://github.com/VioletBitKitten/VTuberVoice)

## VtuberVoice

[VTuberVoice](https://github.com/VioletBitKitten/VTuberVoice) is TTS (Text to Speech) software for vtubers that don't or can't speak.
VTuberVoice is written in FreePascal using the [Microsoft Windows SAPI library for FreePascal](https://github.com/VioletBitKitten/SAPI) I also created.
I created this software because I do not like to talk and there are few solutions for VTubers that don't speak.
